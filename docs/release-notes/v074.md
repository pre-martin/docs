# Stable Release v0.7.4

Our latest release [...]

!!! warning "NOTICE"
**This is the last stable release before the merging of our custom FMS version 1 (cFMS v1).**

    Please use this version if you wish to stay on the default FMS. We however *strongly* recommend using Development and the new FMS unless you need the v0.7.0 base for third-party compatibility.
